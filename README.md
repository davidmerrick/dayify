Ever subscribe to a calendar with multi-day events, and they're not set to be all-day events
so they block your entire goddamn calendar? Does that annoy you?

Well it grinds my gears. That's why I created Dayify.

It's a web service that takes a calendar url and 
gives you back the same calendar with the events
converted to all-day events.

Ah, that's better. 

Better living, with Dayifyâ„¢.

Try it out:

Pro tip: Pass Dayify a calendar you want to subscribe to, have Dayify proxy it, and subscribe to the Dayify URL to give all future events that all-day treatment.
